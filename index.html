      Hero can be anyone. Even a man knowing something as simple and reassuring
      as putting a coat around a young boy shoulders to let him know the world
      hadn’t ended. You fight like a younger man, there’s nothing held back.

      Romans would suspend democracy and appoint one man to protect the city. It
      wasn’t considered an honor, it was a public service. Hero can be anyone.
